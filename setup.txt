We will be creating detailed plan and small status log documents to build a game from the provided XCode project, iOS game template with Gameplay Kit integrated.
The plan will be sectioned in Phases, phase1 etc so we can build and test each phase, one at a time, over several Claude sessions. 
Claude will stop after each phase and ask us to test, offering to make a git commit with details about what was created. It will also update the status log.

The name will be Alien Barrage and the bundle ID will be 
com.biffna.retrostyle1.

The game will be based on the gameplay of Space Invaders, but use the imagery defined in spritesheet.png. 
Claude will copy the spritesheet into the project and use it for the images, hopefully just using the one spritesheet instead of making several images.

The theme is: an evil Alien race of cybernetic beings seeks to assimilate humans and other biological lifeforms - as the human race tries to defend itself.

During the building of the game, Claude will think of ways we can enhance the game with Apple Intelligence and keep that in a separate doc for discussion and planning later. The intention is for devices with Apple Intelligence will use these features but those without will not.
